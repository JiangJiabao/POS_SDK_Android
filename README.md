# myPOS SDK Android

This repository provides a native Android SDK, which enables to integrate your Mobile App with myPOS Card terminals, processed by its platform, to accept card payments (including but not limited to VISA, Mastercard, UnionPay International, JCB, Bancontact). myPOS SDK Android communicates transparently to the card terminal(s) via Bluetooth. To process checkout SDK provides management of the terminal to complete all the steps for transaction processing, return or refund, card storage for recurring transactions, and communicates to the application transaction status, card token, card masked PAN.

No sensitive card data is ever passed through to or stored on the merchant&#39;s phone. All data is encrypted by the card terminal, which has been fully certified to the highest industry standards (PCI, EMV I &amp; II, Visa, MasterCard &amp; Amex).

### Prerequisites

1. Merchant account on [www.myPOS.eu](https://www.mypos.eu/) (or received a test account).
2. Received myPOS terminal
3. Requested Access   [Developers myPOS](http://developers.mypos.eu) site.
4.	Deployment Target Android 4.0.3 or later.

# Integration

As example of integration, please use the sample app provided in this repository as a reference

## Dependency

In Android Studio open Project Structure and choose to add new Module, then 'Import .JAR/.AAR package' and navigate to your copy of icardpossdk.aar library.

Add the dependency to a module in your build.gradle:
```Java
    compile project(':icardpossdk')
```

Add the following dependencies:
```Java
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.0.1'
    compile 'com.android.support:design:25.0.1'
    compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:25.0.1'
    compile 'com.android.support:gridlayout-v7:25.0.1'
    compile 'com.android.support:cardview-v7:25.0.1'
```

## Initialization

Initialize the MyPos components in your app:

```Java
public class SampleApplication extends Application {
	
private POSHandler  mPOSHandler;

@Override
public void onCreate() {
	super.onCreate();
	POSHandler.setCurrency(Currency.EUR);
        POSHandler.setApplicationContext(this);
 	mPOSHandler = POSHandler.getInstance();
}
```

Optional settting for default receipt configuration is avaibale:

```Java
POSHandler.setDefaultReceiptConfig(POSHandler.RECEIPT_PRINT_ONLY_MERCHANT_COPY);
```

If set the default receipt configuration can be removed:

```Java
POSHandler.clearDefaultReceiptConfig();
```

Optional setting for the language of the receipts is avaibale(default is Language.ENGLISH):

```Java
POSHandler.setLanguage(Language.GERMAN);
```

isTerminalBusy() returns boolean to check if an operation is being performed at the moment:
```Java
POSHandler.getInstance().isTerminalBusy();
```

## Connect to terminal

Choose connection type:

```Java
POSHandler.setConnectionType(ConnectionType.BLUETOOTH);
```

```Java
POSHandler.getInstance().connectDevice(context);
```

If connection type is set to BLUETOOTH, make sure ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION permission is given in order to discover available bluetooth devices.

```Java
if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M && ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, 
	Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
            requestPermissions(new String[]{Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION}, PERMISSION_COARSE_LOCATION);
}
```

## Attach connection listener

```Java
mPOSHandler.setConnectionListener(new ConnectionListener() {
    @Override
    public void onConnected(final BluetoothDevice device) {
        // handle connected event here
    }
});
```

## Make payment

Once initialization is completed, you can start using the myPOS SDK Android to accept card payments.

Variant 1. 
Payment via internal SDK activity:
Amount and transaction reference are optional parameters and can be set as null.

```Java
 mPOSHandler.openPaymentActivity(
        MainActivity.this /*activity*/,
        REQUEST_CODE_MAKE_PAYMENT /*requestCode*/,
        "10.50" /*amount*/,
        UUID.randomUUID().toString()/*transaction reference*/
);
```

Variant 2. 
Payment via direct SDK method:
Transaction reference is optional parameter and can be set as null.

```Java
mPOSHandler.purchase(
	"10.50" /*amount*/, 
	UUID.randomUUID().toString() /*transaction reference*/, 
	POSHandler.RECEIPT_PRINT_AUTOMATICALLY /*receipt configuration*/ );
	);
```

## Handle payment result

Variant 1. 
Payment via internal SDK activity:

```Java
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data){
    	if( requestCode == REQUEST_CODE_MAKE_PAYMENT && resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
        		TransactionData transactionData = data.getParcelableExtra(POSHandler.INTENT_EXTRA_TRANSACTION_DATA);
        		// Handle the response here
    	}
}
```

Variant 2. 
Payment via direct SDK method:

```Java
mPOSHandler.setPOSInfoListener(new POSInfoListener() {
    @Override
    public void onPOSInfoReceived(final int command, final int status, final String description) {
        // Handle the response here
    }

    @Override
    public void onTransactionComplete(final TransactionData transactionData) {
        // Handle the response here
    }
});
```
See [POS Info statuses](#pos-info-statuses) for more information

## Refund

With refund host application could initiate refund transaction to the customersâ€™ card account with the specified amount.

Variant 1. 
Refund via internal SDK activity:
Amount and transaction reference are optional parameters and can be set as null.

```Java
 mPOSHandler.openPaymentActivity(
        MainActivity.this /*activity*/,
        REQUEST_CODE_MAKE_REFUND /*requestCode*/,
        "10.50" /*amount*/,
        UUID.randomUUID().toString()/*transaction reference*/
);
```

Variant 2. 
Refund via direct SDK method:
Transaction reference is optional parameter and can be set as null.

```Java
mPOSHandler.purchase(
	"10.50" /*amount*/, 
	UUID.randomUUID().toString() /*transaction reference*/, 
	POSHandler.RECEIPT_PRINT_AUTOMATICALLY /*receipt configuration*/ );
	);
```

## Handle refund result

Variant 1. 
Refund via internal SDK activity:

```Java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data){
    	if( requestCode == REQUEST_CODE_MAKE_REFUND && resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
        		TransactionData transactionData = data.getParcelableExtra(POSHandler.INTENT_EXTRA_TRANSACTION_DATA);
        		// Handle the response here
    	}
}
```

Variant 2. 
Refund via direct SDK method:

```Java
mPOSHandler.setPOSInfoListener(new POSInfoListener() {
    @Override
    public void onPOSInfoReceived(final int command, final int status, final String description) {
        // Handle the response here
    }

    @Override
    public void onTransactionComplete(final TransactionData transactionData) {
        // Handle the response here
    }
});
```
See [POS Info statuses](#pos-info-statuses) for more information

## Reprint last receipt

With this method host application could request reprint of last transaction slip.

```Java
mPOSHandler.reprintReceipt();
```

## Print random receipt

Check if the connected myPOS device has a printer hardware:

```Java
mPOSHandler.hasPrinter()
```

Printing an external receipt is performed by passing a ReceiptData object to the printReceipt() method

```Java
ReceiptData receiptData = new ReceiptData();
receiptData.addLogo(1 /*Logo index*/);
receiptData.addEmptyRow();
receiptData.addRow(
	"HEAD" /*text*/, 
	ReceiptData.Align.CENTER, /* Enum align setting (LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT) */
	ReceiptData.FontSize.DOUBLE /* Enum font size setting (SINGLE, DOUBLE) */
	);
mPOSHandler.printReceipt(receiptData);
```

# Terminal management

## Activate

Before using terminal for a first time the SDK has to initiate Terminal activation, which will setup terminal for processing transaction, setting up Terminal ID, Merchant ID etc.

```Java
mPOSHandler.activate();
```

## Update terminal software

Each time terminal processing transaction, processor host checks for existing pending updates, and inform terminal if any. In that case by this method software update is activated, and terminal is going in the update mode.

```Java
mPOSHandler.update();
```

## Deactivate terminal

```Java
mPOSHandler.deactivate();
```
